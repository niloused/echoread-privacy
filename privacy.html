<h1>Privacy Policy — Word2Talk</h1>
<p class="date">Last Updated: January 16, 2026</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Word2Talk ("we", "our", or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our Chrome Extension.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The Word2Talk extension is designed to convert web articles into speech. To perform this function, the extension collects the following data:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>URL and Content of the Active Tab</strong>: When you explicitly click the "Play" button, the extension sends the URL and the text content of the current active tab to our backend server for processing.</li>
    <li><strong>User Preferences</strong>: We store local preferences (such as playback speed, target language, and voice settings) locally on your device within the browser's storage.</li>
</ol>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Text-to-Speech Processing</strong>: The URL and text content are sent to our servers solely to extract the main article text and convert it into audio.</li>
    <li><strong>No Permanent Storage</strong>: We do not store the text or audio content of the articles you listen to after the session is complete. The data is processed in ephemeral sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Improvement</strong>: We do not use your data for advertising or tracking purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data transmitted to our servers. Communication between the extension and our backend is encrypted using HTTPS.</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Our backend processing may utilize third-party cloud providers (e.g., AWS) for hosting and computation. These providers process data in accordance with their own security standards.</p>

<h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
<p>You can choose not to use the extension on specific pages. The extension only activates and sends data when you explicitly interact with it.</p>

<h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@word2talk.com">info@word2talk.com</a>.</p>
