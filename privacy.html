  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    EchoRead is a Chrome extension designed to convert web articles into natural-sounding audio using real-time summarization and translation technologies. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    EchoRead does <strong>not collect, store, or share</strong> any personally identifiable information (PII) from users. The extension operates locally and sends only the content you request to be processed to our backend services for summarization, translation, and audio generation.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We use trusted cloud providers including <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong> and <strong>AWS SageMaker</strong> to process text data securely. These services process data temporarily to fulfill your request and do not retain any user-related metadata.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    All communications between the extension and our backend are encrypted using HTTPS. No authentication tokens, email addresses, or session data are stored on our servers.
  </p>
